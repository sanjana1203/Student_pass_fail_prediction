# Student Pass or Fail Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a **machine learning–based student performance prediction system**.  
The model predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on academic and performance-related features.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Classification  
- **Domain:** Education / Data Science  
- **Framework:** Python (Scikit-learn)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The project applies supervised learning techniques to classify student outcomes effectively.

## Model Details

- Uses **classification algorithms**
- Trained on student performance data
- Considers features such as internal scores, attendance, and academic parameters
- Outputs **Pass / Fail prediction**

## Workflow

**Data Collection → Data Preprocessing → Feature Selection → Model Training → Pass/Fail Prediction**

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Applications

- Academic performance analysis  
- Early identification of at-risk students  
- Educational decision support systems  
- Machine learning classification projects  

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning classification techniques can be used to analyze student data and predict academic outcomes, supporting data-driven educational insights.
